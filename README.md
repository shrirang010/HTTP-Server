# HTTP Server v1.1


This is a Python-based HTTP server that implements version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol. It is designed to handle various HTTP methods including HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. With multi-threading capabilities, it efficiently manages multiple client connections simultaneously.

## Features

- **HTTP/1.1 Protocol**
- **Built with Socket Programming**
- **Multi-threaded for concurrent multiple client connections**
- **Supported HTTP Methods**
- **Handles status codes**

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python3 installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of HTTP protocols.

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akshaykhoje/HTTP-Server.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd  HTTP-Server
    ```

###  **Run the Server**

## Supported HTTP Methods

- **HEAD**: Retrieve the headers for a resource without the actual content.
- **GET**: Retrieve the content of a resource along with the headers.
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed by a resource, often used for form submissions.
- **PUT**: Create a new resource or replace a representation of the target resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.with the request payload

The above methods can be used as following:
1. HEAD => Use Postman
2. GET => Use Browser/Postman
3. POST => Use Browser/Postman
4. PUT => Use Postman
5. DELETE => Use commandline as follows:
> curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:portNumber/database.txt/id
